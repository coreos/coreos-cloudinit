# HACK: work around ordering between config drive and ec2 metadata It is
# possible for OpenStack style systems to provide both the metadata service
# and config drive, to prevent the two from stomping on each other, force
# this to run after OEM and after metadata (if it exsts). I'm doing this
# here instead of in the oem service because the oem unit is not written
# to disk until the OEM cloud config is evaluated and I want to make sure
# systemd knows about the ordering as early as possible.
# coreos-cloudinit could implement a simple lock but that cannot be used
# until after the systemd dbus calls are made non-blocking.
